It therefore provides the learners with opportunities to develop their full potential in becoming active, responsible, fulfilled citizens of a democratic, non-racial and equal society. Grade R provides the bridge between the learner’s preschool experiences and the formal school system. Grade R educators use learning outcomes and the accompanying assessment standards to meet the specific needs of their learners. They accordingly plan learning opportunities and activities by which these outcomes can be attained.</para>
